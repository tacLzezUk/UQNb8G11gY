                  The AiProf enables users to offer goods, services, and other benefits to other users that may be redeemed in exchange for earnings (such functionality being the “AiProfMarketplace”).

                  <p class="section–description">

                  Where you use the AiProf Marketplace to offer or redeem goods, services, or other benefits in exchange for earnings, any such transaction is entered into directly between you and the legal person making available the relevant goods, services, or other benefits to you or redeeming such goods, services or other benefits from you, as applicable. Without limiting the effect of these Terms of Use in any way, transactions taking place on the AiProf Marketplace are subject to the legal terms of the party offering the relevant goods, services, or other benefits on the AiProf Marketplace (including as stated in the actual listing), and we and our affiliates are not parties to any such transactions save to the extent that we engage in transactions ourselves directly on the AiProf Marketplace. </p>

                  To the extent that AiProf agrees to administer on your behalf via AiProf's account any offer of goods or services or other benefits in exchange for earnings on the AiProf Marketplace, AiProf shall be entitled to retain up to 100% of the earnings received for its benefit in its absolute discretion.

You agree that we have no control over and do not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of any goods, services, or other benefits offered by users, the truth or accuracy of their offers, the ability of users to provide any goods, services or other benefits offered, or that a user will complete or perform a transaction. Save as otherwise expressly agreed with you, we and our affiliates do not act as agents, contractors, partners, or any form of representative of you or any other user of the AiProf Marketplace. Our operation of the AiProf Marketplace should not be taken as an endorsement (express or implied) of any goods, services, or other benefits offered on it, nor of any user.

Where we wish to do this, we will notify you first and allow you to de–list the relevant goods, services, or other benefits, if you do not agree with the revised number of earnings required.

                  If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms of Use, if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
                  Each of the provisions of these Terms of Use operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.
                  
                  These Terms of Use and their subject matter and formation, are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have non–exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any disputes under or in connection with these Terms of Use.
